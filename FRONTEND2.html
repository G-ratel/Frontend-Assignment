<h2>ABOUT ME!! I'm Flattered...</h2>

<P>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life and refuses to be limited in any form in the course of pursuing my goals. There are many things I like to do, see and experience. I like to sleep early and get up late. I like delicious food and comfortable outfits. I like good books and crime-fiction movies. I like to be alone most times and surrounded by people sometimes. I like land and nature. I like people and I like to laugh. <b>I LOVE DESIGN.</b> I am not where I want to be yet but I definitely am not giving up on my dreams. They are very much alive within me.</P>
